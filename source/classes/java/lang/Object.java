     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned

     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by <tt>super.clone</tt>
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method <tt>clone</tt> for class <tt>Object</tt> performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, then a
     * <tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>.

     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface

     * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
     * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
     * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the <code>finalize</code> method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of <tt>finalize</tt> is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The <tt>finalize</tt> method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of <tt>finalize</tt>, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The <tt>finalize</tt> method of class <tt>Object</tt> performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * <tt>Object</tt> may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the <tt>finalize</tt> method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the <tt>finalize</tt> method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The <tt>finalize</tt> method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the <code>finalize</code> method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the <code>Exception</code> raised by this method
